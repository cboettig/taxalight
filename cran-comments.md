Dear CRAN Maintainers,

This release should address the issue observed on the Solaris platform used in CRAN checks,
which does not support the initialization of larger LMDB databases that are supported
on the more widely used Linux, Mac, and Windows platforms.  The Solaris patch as been
confirmed to work successfully on r-hub Solaris test.

Sincerely,

Carl
